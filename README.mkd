nxpUSBlib Library for NXP LPC Microcontrollers with USB
==========================================================

NXP has been kind enough to provide a pretty good USB library for use with their
microcontrollers. There are a few showstopper bugs in the current version that
don't seem to be getting fixed, so I've forked the project here so we can
maintain a community version that includes the fixes.

The original library is from http://www.lpcware.com/content/project/nxpusblib.

## Changelog

  keywords to some global variables)
